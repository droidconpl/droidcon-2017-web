    "sessionDescription": "Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture is widely used in today’s Android apps to separate the view from the view logic and the model by introducing a presenter. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is quite similar to MVP, with the view model acting as an enhanced presenter, using a data binder to keep the view model and the view in sync. By binding the view to view model properties, the data binder can handle view updates, without the need to manually set changed data back to the view (e.g. no more setText() or setVisibility() on a TextView). As with the presenter in MVP, the view model can easily be unit tested. This talk gives an introduction to the MVVM architecture and how it can be used on Android with the data binding library.",

It’s a set of best practices that help to structure code in a layered way, with the ability to test and replace each layer as needed. Could this be the silver bullet that Android needs?<br />I was given the opportunity to start coding Bumble: a greenfield project centred on user experience - no performance sacrifice was acceptable.

Luckily for you there are five principles of object-orientated design that can help us to craft software that is both easy to maintain and extend, these principles are known together as SOLID.<br />In this talk we'll look at what makes up the SOLID acronym and what each principle means for our code - followed by how we can use these principles to improve both the code we maintain and also code we write in the future. Working with legacy code on the android app at Buffer has given me the opportunities to apply these principles when both refactoring and rewriting parts of the project. From this we'll be looking at real world examples to help us understand how the different aspects of SOLID can be implemented into our own projects to create the same result of a better crafting system.<br />By the end of this talk, we'll be more familiar with the concepts of SOLID and how we can use the approach during development to write more maintainable and extensible code.",

More often the answer is no, as many of them need a significant amount of effort to become embedded in an app. Building SDKs for seamless integration is a challenge, especially when you have to deal on the view level. So how do we attack the two-minute integration challenge?<br /><br />In this session we will discuss a set of good practices on how to build a well-structured SDK focusing on the view level. We will take a deep-dive into the different options available for rendering overlays on Android - particularly through an SDK - highlighting capabilities and limitations of each approach.
