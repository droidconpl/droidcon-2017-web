                    All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at droidcon Kraków are required to agree with the following
                    code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all

                    droidcon Kraków is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
                    gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate
                    harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
                    conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
                    violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of
                    the conference organisers.

                <p>
                    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                    appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
                    following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
                    physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected
                    to comply immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized
                    images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
                    clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, droidcon Kraków organizers may take any action they deem
                    appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
                    contact a member of conference staff immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide
                    escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
                    value your attendance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social
                    events.
